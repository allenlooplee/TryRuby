As a Ruby hobbyist, you might have heard of tryruby.org originally created by [why the lucky stiff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff), a great learning tool that enables you to try Ruby inside your browser. Have you ever dreamed of evaluating Ruby expressions right inside your Windows Phone, just like texting inside the Messaging Hub? You've come to the right place.

Features
=======

Though this app is still in its early alpha, here's a list of what I'm working on:

1. Basic REPL for single-line expressions [done]
2. Messaging Hub style texting [done]
3. Error handling for input code [done]
4. Inspect results like irb
5. Multi-line code scenarios
6. Help and learning materials

Build and run
=======

To run TryRuby on Windows Phone, you'll need to build it with [Windows Phone SDK 8.0](http://dev.windows.com/en-us/develop/download-phone-sdk) or higher. The source code is licensed under MIT License.
