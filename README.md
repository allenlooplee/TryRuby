Have you ever thought of evaluating Ruby expressions right inside your Windows Phone just like texting inside the Messaging Hub? You've come to the right place. 

Though this app is still in its early alpha, here's a list of what I'm working on:
1. Basic REPL for single-line expressions [done]
2. Messaging Hub style texting [done]
3. Error handling for input code [done]
4. Inspect results like irb
5. Multi-line code scenarios
6. Help and learning materials
